        <h3>1. ROLE OF EcoBus</h3>
        <p>
          EcoBus only provides a technology platform that connects intending
          travellers with bus operators. It doesn’t operate any bus or offer the
          service of transportation to the User. EcoBus also doesn’t act as an
          agent of any bus operator in the process of providing the
          above-mentioned technology platform services.
        </p>
        <p>
          EcoBus acts as a facilitator connecting intending customers to bus
          operators offering sale of tickets. Accordingly, the contract of sale of
          services on the Website is strictly a bipartite contract between the
          User and the bus operator listed on the Website.
        </p>
        <p>
          The bus ticket booking voucher which EcoBus issues to a User is solely
          based on the information provided or updated by the bus operator
          regarding the seat availability.

        <p>
          The amenities, services, routes, fares, schedule, bus type, seat
          availability and any other details pertaining to the bus service are
          provided by the respective bus operator and EcoBus has no control over
          such information provided by the bus operator.
